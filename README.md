=======

This module is meant to provide an advanced method for handling pricing on configurable products in Magento.

Basically, it will provide a rule interface much like what is used for Shopping Cart and Product Pricing rules in the Promotions section.
By Default, configurable product pricing is based on a price modifier set for a specific option value, but that value is static and does
not change based on other selections.

Features:
========

- Specify configuration pricing based on specified configuration combinations
- Automatically generate all child products for all configuration combinations
